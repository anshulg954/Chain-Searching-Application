# Chain-Searching-Application
This application aims on retrieving the peptide sequences from many available databases present online and then building a peptide utility search application. The platform provides the users with two options either to find in homologous sequence or an identical match. This application can be used to search the sequence from 0.4 million database entries present in both online and offline mode which can be further used to study various kind of interactions and designing of peptides. Finally, it will open up avenues for peptide design relevant in pharmacological interventions.
